# amazon-clone

As it is clear from the name of the project, in this project I tried to implement the Amazon website with React. This project has a lot of possibilities and I have tried to apply everything I have learned and challenge myself. In short, this project includes the implementation of front and back-end with the help of technologies related to JavaScript. Things like: creating database to MongoDB database, creating dynamic pages and interacting with the server side using API, creating a dedicated API. Connecting to the payment gateway. Shopping cart, single product page, product page, three different panels for admin and seller users. Authentication system with BASIC and JWT methods and many other features.

## some technologies

### In front

`JavaScript`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `React`, `ChartJS`

### In backend

`Nodejs`, `Expressjs`, `MongoDB`
